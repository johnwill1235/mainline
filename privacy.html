            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the Main Line app handles information when you use our services.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Main Line uses your device's location services solely to determine your nearest SEPTA station and provide relevant train schedule information. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Location data is used only locally on your device to determine the nearest train station</li>
                <li>No location data is sent to external servers or third parties</li>
                <li>No personal information is collected or stored</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All app preferences are stored locally on your device</li>
                <li>No user data is transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>Train schedule data is retrieved directly from SEPTA's public API</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>This app uses SEPTA's public transit API to retrieve real-time schedule information. No personal data is shared with SEPTA or any other third parties.</p>

            <h2>Location Services</h2>
            <p>The Main Line app requests access to your device's location to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically determine your nearest SEPTA station</li>
                <li>Provide relevant train schedules for your location</li>
                <li>Enhance your user experience by showing the most relevant information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You can control location access through your iPhone's Settings app. The app will continue to function without location access, but you will need to manually select stations.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect or transmit personal data, there is minimal risk to your privacy. All app functionality happens locally on your device, ensuring your information stays private.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for use by all ages.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and within the app. The "Last updated" date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.</p>
