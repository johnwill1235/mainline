            <p>Welcome to Main Line. These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Main Line mobile application (the "App") operated by John Williams ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms, then you may not use the App.</p>

            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Main Line is a mobile application that provides real-time SEPTA train schedule information for stations along Philadelphia's Main Line. The App displays departure times, delays, and other transit information sourced from SEPTA's public API.</p>

            <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing and using the App, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.</p>

            <h2>3. Use License</h2>
            <p>Permission is granted to temporarily use the Main Line app for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>modify or copy the app materials</li>
                <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial)</li>

                <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Accuracy and Reliability</h2>
            <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the transit data displayed in the App. The information is sourced from SEPTA's public API and may be subject to delays, errors, or changes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always verify critical travel information through official SEPTA channels. Do not rely solely on this App for time-sensitive travel decisions.</p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall Main Line App or its developers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the App or the information provided within, even if Main Line App or its authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that transit schedules can change without notice and that delays, cancellations, and service disruptions may occur. We are not responsible for any inconvenience, missed connections, or other issues resulting from reliance on the information provided by the App.</p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
